# Go Interpreter Series

This repository is my learning journey of building an interpreter from scratch in GO

The goal of this repo is to document each step as I gradually build a tiny interpreter in Go, starting from a basic arithmetic evaluator to something more advanced.

## ðŸ“– About
Interpreters are programs that execute code directly without compiling it into machine code.  
This series walks through the foundations of interpreters:

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing input text)  
- Parsing (understanding expressions)  
- Evaluating (producing results)  

Currently, the interpreter supports **basic arithmetic expressions** like addition and subtraction.

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

Make sure you have Go installed ([download here](https://go.dev/dl/)).

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/go-interpreter-series.git
cd go-interpreter-series
```
