# Go Interpreter Series

This repository is my learning journey of building an interpreter from scratch in GO

The goal of this repo is to document each step as I gradually build a tiny interpreter in Go, starting from a basic arithmetic evaluator to something more advanced.

## ðŸ“– About
Interpreters are programs that execute code directly without compiling it into machine code.  
This series walks through the foundations of interpreters:

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing input text)  
- Parsing (understanding expressions)  
- Evaluating (producing results)  

## ðŸ“‚ Versions
 Each version progressively adds new features to the interpreter:
  
- **Version 1** â†’ Supports addition and subtraction `1 + 1`, `2 - 1`
- **Version 2** â†’ Supports chained addition & substraction  `30+40-20+5`  
- **Version 3** â†’ Supports multiplication and division `2 * 3`, `6 / 2`
- **Version 4** â†’ Supports Chained arithmetic expressions (`2 + 3 - 1 * 4 / 2`)  
- **Version 5** â†’ Supports full arithmetic with nested parentheses  `7 + 3 * (10 / (12 / (3 + 1) - 1)) / (2 + 3) - 5 - 3 + (8))`
-  **Version 6** â†’  Has a basic Parser & AST with all the  previous feature intact

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

Make sure you have Go installed ([download here](https://go.dev/dl/)).
