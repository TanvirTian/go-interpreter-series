# Go Interpreter Series

This repository is my learning journey of building an interpreter from scratch in GO

The goal of this repo is to document each step as I gradually build a tiny interpreter in Go, starting from a basic arithmetic evaluator to something more advanced.

## ðŸ“– About
Interpreters are programs that execute code directly without compiling it into machine code.  
This series walks through the foundations of interpreters:

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing input text)  
- Parsing (understanding expressions)  
- Evaluating (producing results)  

Currently, the interpreter supports:

âœ… Addition (+)

âœ… Subtraction (-)

âœ… Multiplication (*)

âœ… Division (/)

âœ… Chained arithmetic expressions (e.g. 12 / 3 * 2 + 4 - 1)
